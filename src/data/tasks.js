    title: "Object-Oriented Programming",
    doc: "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code into objects that encapsulate data and behavior. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, and it allows you to implement OOP principles. In JavaScript, objects can be created using either functions or classes. Below, I'll show you examples of both approaches.",

    title: "ML stands for Machine Learning.",
    doc: "ML stands for Machine Learning. It is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. The primary goal of machine learning is to allow computers to improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed for that task.",
